Welcome to Open-Ribbon's Vib-Ribbon Technical Database! This documentation is currently under construction, so as a result, many things about it will change over time, whether it be the information provided or the visual and technical aspects of the repository. This info repository was made by the [Open-Ribbon server](https://discord.gg/cXVGPEmXK4), a server dedicated to decompiling and researching Vib-Ribbon for the Sony PlayStation.

Additionally, for full documentation on the documentation engine, MkDocs, visit [here](https://www.mkdocs.org).

## What is Vib-TD?

Much like the Discord server it is based from, the Vib-Ribbon Technical Database is what contains most of the information about the game that we currently know of, whether it be related to the game's source code, bugs that have been discovered, oddities, non-game topics, etc.

### What is Vib-Ribbon?

For those who may not be in the loop, Vib-Ribbon is a game created by Masaya Matsuura, following the release of the smash success that was PaRappa the Rapper. It was released on the original PlayStation by his company NanaOn-Sha in Japan on December 9, 1999, and in Europe on August 30, 2000. It would not see an American release until the European ROM was mirrored over to the PlayStation Network to be available globally, during October 2014 after some unexpected hype during an official event.
